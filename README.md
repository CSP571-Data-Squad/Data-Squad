## Overview
We would like to use regression to build models for homicide rate prediction at a country level. We plan to utilize socio-economic indicators as input to predict the homicide rate of a country. This predictive capability then provides a good influence association between socio-economic indicators and crime that the government could use to try to improve the situation in those countries. Furthermore, we will evaluate and improve each model, and end with a report deliverable of our project and a web based piece of software that predicts homicide rate for a given country. 

## Datasets
This data source contains data on a large number of socio-economic indicators for almost all the countries in the world under various categories including economic, gender and education. From the viewpoint of data, the bottleneck in our analysis is not the limited number of socio-economic indicators. It is the number of countries compared to the number of possible socio-economic indicators so that we do not run into the “curse of dimensionality” problem. This data source was chosen because the data is reliable, open source and the sources of data have been cited on the website. Another reason for selecting this data source is the quantitative nature of the predictors and the target variable-the economic and social predictors that we will be using in our model have an interpretable, physical basis and make business sense.

## Deliverables
